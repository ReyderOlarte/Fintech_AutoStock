# autoStock
AutoStock open source algorithmic trading platform

This was my somewhat failed attempt at an algorithmic trading platform. Lot's of work has been done on and and someone else might have better luck.
 - Uses Interactive Brokers and IB as a backend through TWS
 - Forward price prediction
 - Engagement
 - Market scanning 
 - Neural Network tactic / combination for signals 
 - Basic charting
 - Genetic network for solving cobinational problems like position time entry etc 
 - It only really does inter-day trading, probably to its disadvantage
